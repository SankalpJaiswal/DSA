# DSA

**Space Complexity -->** Memory                             <br>
It is the amount of space required to solve a problem.      <br>
sc = Auxiary space + Input size

<hr>

**Time Complexity -->** No. of line                                                 <br>
It is mainly calculated by counting the no. of steps to finish the execution.

<hr>

**Big O notation -->** used to denote complexity (both)

<hr>

**Recursion (Direct Recursion) -->** function called inside function with proper condition to avoid infinite loop <br>
function apple = () =>{                     <br>
&emsp;    apple();                          <br>
&emsp;    (with proper condition)
}

<hr>

**Indirect Recursion -->**      <br>
function apple = () =>{         <br>
&emsp;    banana ()             <br>
}                               <br>

<br>

function banana = () =>{        <br>
&emsp;    apple()               <br>
}

<hr>

**Debugger -->** From "Sources" (right of "Console") in inspect

<hr>

**STACK -->** First In Last Out     <br>
**QUEUE -->** First In First Out

<hr>

**Class Component -->** Whenever we call Class component, 'Constructor' is called first
